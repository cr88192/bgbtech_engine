    Textures are collections of associated files, and are generally
    identified by<br>
    the name of the "base image".<br>
    <br>
    Typically, this base image is required to exist, and also gives the
    image size<br>
    (typically used in calculating ST coordinates).<br>
    <br>
    Other files:<br>
    ".txt", gives information about the texture;<br>
    "_add.*" or "_luma.*", gives the glow map;<br>
    "_norm.*" or "_local.*", gives the normal map;<br>
    "_norm_alpha.*" or "_local_alpha.*", gives the height map;<br>
    "_gloss.*", gives the specular color map;<br>
    "_gloss_alpha.*", gives the specular exponent-scale map.<br>
    <br>
    Internally, the "_alpha" textures are loaded into the alpha channels
    of their<br>
    associated images, and are assumed to be monochrome.<br>

    Texture info:<br>
    <br>
    $flags<br>
    Gives relevant flags about a texture.<br>
