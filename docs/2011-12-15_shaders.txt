Textures are collections of associated files, and are generally identified by
the name of the "base image".

Typically, this base image is required to exist, and also gives the image size
(typically used in calculating ST coordinates).

Other files:
".txt", gives information about the texture;
"_add.*" or "_luma.*", gives the glow map;
"_norm.*" or "_local.*", gives the normal map;
"_norm_alpha.*" or "_local_alpha.*", gives the height map;
"_gloss.*", gives the specular color map;
"_gloss_alpha.*", gives the specular exponent-scale map.

Internally, the "_alpha" textures are loaded into the alpha channels of their
associated images, and are assumed to be monochrome.
