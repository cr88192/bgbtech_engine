Squid Culture Ideas

Squid Appearance:
Armored Cephlopod-style creature, technically more like an octopus;
Will often walk on 4 or 6 arms, with 2 or 4 front arms for tasks;
They will have a face vaguely like that of a human.

Their outer armor resembles plate armor, and is integrated into their skin.

Standing size is typically 20-25 feet.

Biologically they are a mix of human, cephlopod, and alien biology (from tiny alien invertebrates), as well as incorporating nano-machinery into their cells.

Their mind is spread between their biological brains and something resembling a conventional Unix-like OS.


Humans:
Large humanoids are also present within the Squid population, but are biological hybrids. They have blue-gray skin, and also typically have integrated body armor;
Standing size is typically around 15 feet.

Some humanoids may also exist at smaller sizes, typically around 5 or 6 feet tall, and will generally lack body armor. Many will have bluish skin.
