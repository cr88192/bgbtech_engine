well, there is a tiny kitten which was found.
so, the kitten is very little, maybe about the size of a rat.
still, he is capable of running around and making noise, and in general acts a good deal like a larger cat would, although the larger cats don't really respond to him so well (angry, hissing, ...).

sadly, we wont be able to take him, so will have to find someone to give him to.

but, oh well, I am doing good enough I guess...
the movers will be here in a few days to take away all the stuff...


I guess I am distracted right now by a movie parents are watching.
basically, it is a horror movie with a bit much screaming and yelling and profanities. I guess, anymore, I don't really respond as well to these sorts of movies...

it is odd, when I was young, I saw lots of movies like this (a large portion of movies parents watch are of this sort, not all necessarily horror, but far too often with lots of screaming and yelling and people getting killed, and usually played with the volume loud...). but, now, I just don't so much want to see them anymore, nor like hearing then, since apart from whatever is the main plot people spend most of their time yelling profanities at each other...

I don't know, I just don't really like these kinds of movies...
