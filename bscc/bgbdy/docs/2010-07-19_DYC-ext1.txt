void *dycGetMethodAddr(dycClass inf, dycMethod idx);

Get a function pointer which can be called directly with an object of a given class.

If inf is an interface or NULL, then the returned function will attempt to call a given method with any object it is given, but may fail (via throwing an exception) if the method does not exist for a given object.

void *dycGetMethodAddrSig(dycClass inf, char *name, char *sig);

void *dycGetIfaceVTable(dycClass inf);
