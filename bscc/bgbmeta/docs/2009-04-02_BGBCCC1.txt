Goals:
Make compiler operate in terms of a self-contained memory manager, which post-compilation can discard its entire heap.

Similarly, trying to optimize it some could help.


Approach:
'dyx' is internalized, and redirected to a new 'malloc';
preprocessor is modified to use structs, as had been done for the assembler's preprocessor.
