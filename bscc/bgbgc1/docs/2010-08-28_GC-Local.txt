Idea:
Put Local/Temporary heap support into the GC.

This will have the following properties:
Objects need to be allocated in local heaps explicitly;
When a local heap is destroyed, all contained objects are also destroyed;
The only way to move local objects to the global heap is to copy them.

A few provisions will be made:
The GC will be able to have roots in local heaps;
Dynamic types will be available with local heaps.

dyt gclNewLocal();		//new empty local heap
void gclDelLocal(dyt heap);	//delete local heap

void *gclAlloc(dyt heap, size_t size);
void *gclTAlloc(dyt heap, char *ty, size_t size);
