Premise:
API for token buffer/stream;
Also manages buffering issues.

Location:
Uncertain, BGBASM makes sense because it is used by upper layers, but upper layers are not used by BGBASM.

BGBGC is another possibly sane location.


Possible API:
BSCC_BufferStream		//abstract structure (maybe a dynamic type)

BSCC_BufferStream *BSCC_NewBufStrm();
New empty buffer stream (output).
