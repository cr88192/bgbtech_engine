Alternate VM:
All stack items are value-references (rather than values);
Scope has delegation;
VM has packages/namespaces (implemented via delegation);
No built in operator behavior (overloading only);
Core language operators implemented via a package.

Type Model:
Variant + Inferred Static;
Variables are explicitly typed;
Type information exists at the point of declaration (not reference).

Scope:
Lexical Scope may be referenced by index, and is treated like a lexical variable stack;
Toplevel and Object variables are referenced symbolically.
