This will attempt to define and focus the current and future direction of the VM.

So, the general structure thus far is:
	Blocks filled with bytecode;
	Tables holding literal values.

Assembly Dumps (bsa):
;comment
BLOCK name flags nlit ( args* )
	litnum litval
	...
BODY
	ops
	...

For the literal tables, the numbers will be mostly for illustration.
the rest of the line will be assumed to contain the value (most types will be serialized the same as s-exps).
