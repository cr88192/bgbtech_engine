Vector Heap (Idea)

Idea:
Special side heap for storage of vectors and other small packed numeric types (all items are fixed size);
This heap will have a small and finite size.

Purpose:
This will allow more efficient inference and processing of common vector types and allow making use of the SSE and SSE2 instruction sets.

Implementation
An array of 16 byte (128 bit) members;
An array of 16 bit ushorts (serving both header and GC purposes);
A misc type BS1_MM_VECOBJ, which will hold a handle (currently 20 bits, with an additional 4 low bits which are always 0);
Values may be regarded as mutable (consider, maybe too problematic implementation wise);
...

Likely Types
double, 64 bit double using 1/2 object;
complex, 2 64 bit doubles;
widenum-128, 128 bit widenum.

vec2, 2-float vector;
vec3, 3-float vector;
vec4, 4-float vector.
