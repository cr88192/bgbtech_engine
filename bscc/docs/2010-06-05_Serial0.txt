Considered ideas for a binary serialization:
has a header, an array of declarations, and packed serialized data.

the data is represented primarily structurally, and little is assumed WRT semantics.
the serialized objects are represented as a hetrogeneous array of objects.

a single object may be identified as the root object.

types will be handled via a signature array, and via indices into this array.
