    <h1>BGBScript Object and Types Model</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Unified Object Model</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    In an ideal sense, BGBScript will use a sort of unified
    Class/Instance and Prototype OO like model.<br>
    <br>
    Class/Instance OO is a commonly used system, whereby one defines
    classes, and then creates instances of them.<br>
    <br>
    BGBScipt will use a single-inheritence model with support for the
    addition of interfaces. Multiple inheritence will not be directly
    supported.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, BGBScript will support "dynamic classes", which allow
    the addition of fields and methods to objects on a per-instance
    basis. Conceptually, these will be equivalent to prototype objects,
    differing primarily in the existence of a base class (proper
    prototype objects will not have a base class).<br>
    <br>
    Cloning and delegation may be used with any object, regardless of
    whether it is a prototype or class/instance object, and regardless
    of the dynamic modifer.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    When an object is cloned, a new object is created which contains the
    same field values as the parent object, or essentially it is a copy
    of the parent object. In BGBScript, by default, a parent object and
    its cloned object are semantically-disjoint, as-in, modifications to
    one will not effect the other.<br>
    <br>
    Cloning will be performed via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">clone()</span>
    method.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Static Binding or Dynamic Binding (Duck Typing)</h2>
    <br>
    The semantics of method binding will depend on the type of the
    target object.<br>
    <br>
    If the type of an object is statically known and the method or field
    is statically visible, then static binding will be used. Otherwise,
    if the object is dynamic or the type is variant, then dynamic
    binding will be used. Otherwise the field or method will be regarded
    as undefined.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the type of binding used will depends on the types of
    declarations, rather than the run-time object types.<br>
    <br>
    class Foo { ... function foo() ... }<br>
    var obj1=new Foo();<br>
    var obj2:Foo=new Foo();<br>
    obj1.foo();<br>
    obj2.foo();<br>
    <br>
    Despite the fact that the object is a static class-based type,
    because obj1 is implicitly of a variant type, then binding will be
    dynamic.<br>
    However, in the case of obj2, static binding will be used for the
    method call.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Type Semantics</h3>
    <br>
    BGBScript will use a hybrid type model. In this model, both static
    and dynamic type semantics may be used as-needed.<br>
    <br>
    If a type is declared with a variable, this will be the assumed
    static type of the variable. If no type is given for a particular
    variable, its type will be assumed to be variant.<br>
    <br>
    However, at present, the language may not necessarily enforce
    type-safety with the use of statically-typed variables (the behavior
    of expressions which are not type-safe is undefined). Ideally, the
    compiler should catch and report these situations, however,
    implementation may infact do little more than to treat the types of
    declarations as an optimization hint (Update: this is partially
    addressed, namely in many cases the VM will attempt to coerce the
    value to the correct type).<br>
    <br>
    In other cases, the compiler may be allowed to use type-inference,
    whereby a variable declared as variant, or with a type which is not
    directly (lexically) visible from the point of reference may still
    be inferred to be of a particular type. If and when this is done is
    a matter left up to the implementation.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, if and when implicit type-conversions are performed is
    presently also a matter left to the implementation, and the behavior
    of implicit conversions should not be relied upon (thus, and
    necessary type conversions should be declared explicitly).<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, the exact physical representation of value types at any
    given moment is additionally up to the implementation, and as such
    the overhead or exact "native" range or accuracy some types will not
    be gueranteed (Rationale: This is mostly to simplify the case of
    using "fixnum" and "flonum" types, which may more cheaply store
    values, but may in some cases shave off several bits from the type,
    or may involve transparently "boxing" out-of-range values).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Delegation</h2>
    <br>
    With delegation, fields may be created which link to other objects.
    When an access is made to one object, but can't be directly handled
    by said object, it may be delegated to the other objects which it
    links to. This operation may take place recursively. The
    implementation will implement a mechanism to prevent infinite
    recursion (it will be considered an implementation requirement that
    the search will not recurse through the same object more than once).<br>
    <br>
    When using delegation, the operation is to behave as if it were
    taking place from the point of view of the original source object
    for which the request was directed. In this way, a called method
    will be called with "this" holding the original object, rather than
    the object which actually contains the method (delegation will also
    allow that any fields in the final object also be accessible from
    the source object).<br>
    <br>
    Generally, delegate fields or variables will be indivated by use of
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">delegate </span>modifier.<br>
    <br>
    Note that delegate will also be allowed on lexical and dynamic
    variables, and will serve to treat any referenced object as if it
    were a part of the respective scope.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Delegation Example:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <pre>class Foo<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var x;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public function foo() { return x; }<br>}<br><br>class Bar<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public delegate var lfoo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //this field delegates to another object<br>}<br><br>var ofoo=new Foo();<br>var obar=new Bar();<br><br>obar.lfoo=ofoo; //Links obar to ofoo.<br><br>obar.foo();<br>//calls foo(), where <span style="font-weight: bold;">this</span>==<span style="font-weight: bold;">obar</span>, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">this.x</span> will give the value of the field in <span style="font-weight: bold;">ofoo</span>.<br></pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Toplevel</h2>
    <br>
    The toplevel in BGBScript will be implemented through the use of
    objects.<br>
    A special variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">top </span>will

    identify the current toplevel object. By default, the objects used
    for implementing the toplevel and packages will be dynamic so as to
    allow freely adding fields and methods to them.<br>
    <br>
    Note that even though the toplevel is implemented using objects,
    this does not mean that methods existing at the toplevel or at
    package scope levels will have a value for <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">this</span>. Instead, accesses to the
    toplevel will be through top, and both top and any package imports
    will be regarded as a part of the lexical environment.<br>
    <br>
    Note that packages will be contained within the toplevel, and hence
    package names will identify a path relative to the current toplevel
    object. As a result, it will also be possible to execute code with
    different toplevels and, hence, different package visibility.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Permissions (optional)<br>
    </h2>
    <br>
    BGBScript will support dynamic permission checking. Every thread
    will implicitly have a UID which will identify which rights it has
    and which may be used to determine what fields, methods, and objects
    may be accessed by this thread. Permissions will be considered
    disjoint from what is otherwise controlled by modifiers, as a
    modifier will apply to everyone, whereas a permission will exist on
    a per-user basis.<br>
    <br>
    Major permissions will be:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read (R);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write (W);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute (X).<br>
    <br>
    Having Read access will mean the ability to retrieve the values of
    fields or to get handles for methods. If a thread does not have read
    access to an object, it will not be possible to retrieve the value
    of any field or method within the object. Lacking read access to a
    field or method will mean an inability access the particular field
    or method.<br>
    <br>
    Write access will mean the ability to modify objects or fields. As
    may be expected, an object without a write permission may not be
    modified, and a field without write permission will be treated as if
    it were read-only.<br>
    <br>
    Execute will mean the ability to call methods in an object, or to
    execute particular function objects. Execute by itself does not
    grant the right to hold the handle of a function object.<br>
    <br>
    Read/Write/Execute permission will also limit delegation traversal,
    where lacking a permission for an object for a given operation will
    also disallow delegation through the object regarding this
    operation.<br>
    <br>
    Note that semantics will differ slightly for properties:<br>
    Read or Write access will grant the ability to execute a given
    get/set handler rather than this being handled by Execute.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Keyring</h3>
    <br>
    The rights of a given UID may be specified via a keyring, which will
    be a set of secondary UIDs associated with a primary UID. The
    keyring will serve a similar purpose to an ACL. A given permission
    will be granted to a UID if the permission is granted to any UID
    within its keyring.<br>
