<h1>Silverfish</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This will attempt to provide an
overview of my “Silverfish VM” effort (note: Silverfish
is a re-dub of BSCC). For sake of mention, yes, Silverfish are a type
of insect, of the most lowly variety which live under ones laundry
and live on a diet of lint and similar. However, in this case, I will
use the notion of the silverfish, as said lowly insect, to stand for
the general design philosophy of the effort. I am not trying to make
some big flashy project or to make some revolution in how people view
computers. In fact, as I see it, the VM is not something which should
really be seen much at all, if possible. Silent and invisible, much
as the insects hiding under some old socks or a t-shirt placed most
subtly in the middle of ones' floor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Well, and also a silverfish is a sort
of branding which can be both elegant sounding and tacky at the same
time.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
The Silverfish VM is a collection
of libraries and other things intending to facilitate compiling C,
and several other languages, at run-time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The goal is to avoid being a monolithic
VM of the sort that is the Java VM or .NET VM, so instead the
intention is to try to keep the design fairly open and modular (the
reason being so that components can be added and replaced fairly
easily, and that hopefully it should be possible to implement clone
implementations). Similarly, I try to keep the APIs as being fairly
general purpose and clean, and avoid unnecessary interdependencies
between components (although some level of interdependency is
inevitable with a project of this sort...).<br>
<br>
Likewise, I see no
real reason to try to create yet another "the one bytecode to
rule them all", nor to go and try to re-invent the world in my
own image...<br>
<br>
Instead, I try to incorporate things which
already exist, namely:<br>
The huge mass of code and libraries written
in C and C++;<br>
...<br>
<br>
Similarly, it is not my intent to try to force
anyone over to an essentially "new" way of developing apps.
Ideally, the whole framework should not be too much more
than a pile libraries one can link in (though... sadly... one does
have to make provisions for things like header-files, library files,
a directory to cache compiled-code and metadata, ...). An app's
codebase should be able to stay much as it was before all this.<br>
<br>
As
such, my project primarily focuses on generating native code for x86
and x86-64, and operating (more or less) at a similar level of
abstraction to natively compiled and linked code. Granted, my project
does make use of custom calling-conventions in several places, and a
good deal of metadata (to a large extent automatically mined from any
included header files), but effort has been put in trying to keep
these borders as transparent as is reasonable (having to write wrapper
code, or jerk off some kind of FFI machinery, is IMO a blight
of most existing VM technology...). Further granted, some of this
does come at the cost of there being some level of "voodoo
magic" in the linker (primarily in the form of invoking
automatic code generators to resolve symbols, ...).<br>
<br>
I don't
make the "compile once, run everywhere" claim, since as I
see it, this kind of thing rarely pans out in practice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why
dynamic compilation? Because C just really needs eval...<br>
As I see
it, one of the major reasons we keep seeing all manner of VMs and
interpreters, is due to a simple reason:<br>
The more traditional
approaches provide severe limitations on ones' ability to dynamically
generate code or extend the current app;<br>
Many existing pieces of
interpreter technology tend to not really address "general
purpose" issues, most often with a bent of expressing the
creative ideation of some particular language designer (typically
wishing to remake the world in his image and/or rid the world from
the perceived horror and tyranny of the C-family...);<br>
Conservatively
addressing issues in a VM is just a whole hell of a lot of effort...<br>

<h3>Overview of General Ideas</h3>
<p><a href="2010-04-10_Meta2.html">Metadata Spec</a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The contents of the Metadata Spec are
fairly central, as much of the VM framework's architecture revolves
around this.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>GAST</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">GAST is a format for representing
"Generalized ASTs".<br>
The format is XML based, and usually stored externally in the SBXE
format.<br>

<h4>BGBScript2</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">BGBScript2 (or BS2) is a new language
and VM currently under development (as of 2011-02-26). Design and
development began in early December 2010, mostly as an attempt to
revive an idea of mine from 2005, and partly due to some frustrastions
with the legacy of the JVM architecture.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The language was largely influenced by
Java, C#, and ActionScript3.<br>
Clean interoperation with C (and, secondarily, C++) is also a design
goal.<br>
The core syntax mostly follows C/Java/... tradition, but does vary on a
few notably points mostly to try to help limit syntactic ambiguity.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The exact design of this VM and language
is still partly in flux.<br>

Update: As of 2011-04-28:<br>
The BGBScript2 language effort has been effectively mothballed, with
effort shifted to a less ambitious BGBScript 1.5 language, which
basically merges BGBScript and BGBScript2 into a single language (and
is built on a modified form of the pre-existing VM).</p>

<h3>Overview of General Components</h3>
<h4>BGBASM</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This contains the assembler and linker,
where the assembler is a good old assembler for x86 and x86-64,
supporting an Intel/NASM style syntax (incomplete GAS support), and a
C-style preprocessor (I needed one and this is what I happened to
have on-hand...). It is generally the idea that code be produced in
the form of textual ASM, and assembled with the assembler (JIT
compilers hand-crafting machine code is IMO both tacky and fragile,
as well as introducing many other issues).<br>
<br>
The assembler
supports 2 major styles:<br>
The creation of top-level modules, which
are assumed to be linked into the running image, and which share the
same space as all the other modules (namespaces and similar can be
achieved through the use of name-mangling);<br>
The creation of
standalone thunks, which are typically linked into their own custom
chucks of garbage-collected executable memory, and which make use of
a different approach to external linking (scopes may be passed in,
and symbols are not required to be kept up to date).<br>
<br>
The
linker is partly joined with the assembler, but is done as a separate
stage. The linker mostly functions similarly to a conventional linker
(takes object modules, links them together), and may accept COFF,
ELF, and static libraries (GNU-AR), and also allows exporting code
from the assembler into object modules, but differs partly in that it
allows a few novel features (particularly in that it allows other
subsystems to hook into it for purposes such as fetching or emitting
custom symbols, or registering handlers such that automatic code
generation can take place as a means to resolve symbols, as well as
including machinery for things like gluing together several different
calling conventions, accessing thread-local-storage, ...).<br>
<br>
The
linker has primary responsibility over managing the running image and
keeping track of the symbol table.<br>
<br>
It is assumed that if
porting to a new arch, the assembler and/or linker could be modified
or rewritten to support the arch in question.<br>
<br>

Spec</a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<h4>BGBGC</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This is the main Garbage Collector.
Beyond garbage collection, it also manages thread creation, Thread
Local Storage, and a few other things (mostly so that it knows about
thread stacks and can keep track of references located in TLS). The
collector is conservative and uses concurrent mark/sweep, and a
software write barrier. As an added feature, it keeps track of
allocation types (in terms of a string-based nmonic), and allows the
registration of certain behavior modifiers for objects. Support for
precise collection (with ref-counting) is also in place, but not
presently used. The collector is specialized for handling large
numbers of small objects. Most objects are allocated with a 16-byte
granularity, but 8 bytes are needed for the header, however
cons-cells are special and are 8 or 16 bytes each (depends on x86 or
x86-64) and do not use headers.<br>
<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="2009-12-29_BGBGC0.html">BGBGC
Spec</a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<h4>BGBDY</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This library builds on the GC
(originally, BGBDY and BGBGC were the same library, but they were
later split), and implements a full-fledged dynamic typesystem
(fixnum, flonum, symbol, keyword, list, ...), code for
serialization/deserialization of data (S-Exps), a VFS (Virtual File
System), XML support, OO (Prototype-based and Single-Inheritance
Class/Instance + Interfaces and Structs), Namespace and Metadata
management, ...<br>
<br>
This library also contains DYLL, which is a
subset mostly dedicated to particularly low-level tasks, namely
managing most of the metadata structures, a good deal of code for
automatic thunk generation (such as for gluing between abstract
requests and invoking native C functions, ...). It also contains most
of the code responsible for the signature system, which is used for
dynamically managing the static typesystem.<br>
<br>
The
signature-string format is specified, and is actually a fairly
central structure gluing together nearly all parts of this project.
The string format combines together elements of the JVM's signature
string format with elements from the IA-64 name mangling scheme
(primarily, the general structure is from the JVM, but the specific
type notation is mostly from the IA-64 convention). The strings often
operate mostly standalone, but are used in conjunction with the
metadata system.<br>

</p>
<h4>BGBSVM</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The BGBSVM component is also known as
the BGBScript VM.<br>
It currently implements the BGBScript 1.5 language compiler/interpreter.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As of recently (Feb 2011 through June
2011) its role has been expanded considerably.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>RPNIL/SXIL</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This represents the current middle-end
of the compiler. The input is in a language known as RPNIL, which is
an RPN-based IL. It is passed in as a textual format with a syntax
vaguely resembling a hybrid of PostScript and COBOL (the syntax was
designed to be easy to parse, not pretty to look at). Internally, it
is parsed into a bunch of in-memory structures and bytecode
fragments, but these are mostly an implementation detail (it is not
my belief that the bytecode should be exposed externally, and rather
a textual IL should remain as the canonical format), which are then
used to drive the main code generation machinery. The output is in
the form of textual ASM. This compiler is not (semantically)
important to the framework (It works in terms of compiling a single
module at a time, and all used information is either passed in with
the input, or is grabbed from external sources).<br>
<br>
SXIL was a
name given to the library, as at the time I had intended to rewrite
the RPNIL compiler to accept a newer (S-Expression based) IL, but
this idea fizzled out (mostly in concern over garbage production and
compiler-performance issues).<br>
<br>
(At present, RPNIL can't
directly accept JBC or MSIL derived input mostly as a result of there
being different conventions for argument passing and because this
difference is not presently straightforwards to resolve...).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="2010-01-06_BGBSXIL0.html">BGB
SXIL Spec</a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
Status Update: As of 2011-02-26, depending on success with the BS2VM
effort, the BS2IL Assembler syntax may begin to phase out the RPNIL
syntax.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As of 2011-06-18, most new effort has
shifted to the BGBScript VM. RPNIL may continue for now, but this
component may later be partially repurposed as a new BGBScript JIT or
similar.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<h4>BGBCCC/BGBMeta</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This is the C Compiler core, or as I
often call it, the "upper compiler". This library contains
the preprocessor, main parser, and upper-end compiler machinery. The
current compiler is built around the internal use of XML trees (in a
DOM-style representation), and like the RPNIL/SXIL compiler, does its
own internal memory management (this is primarily a garbage-control
strategy, as the compiler may produce an "absurd" amount of
garbage in a very short period of time, and it proves preferable
performance-wise to keep all the garbage contained and simply destroy
the heap when done). output produced is textual RPNIL.<br>
<br>
This
library also provides the main API for the compiler, and is presently
responsible for orchestrating the rest of the compiler stages. It is
also this stage which is the primary producer of metadata, although
it does not manage the metadata itself (this is presently done by
BGBDY/DYLL). Beyond C, this library is also responsible for the (thus
far incomplete) C++, Java, and C# compilers (these share most of the
compiler machinery between them).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
BGBMeta is the name of this component when it is being used as a
metadata generation tool.<br>

</p>
<h4>BGBSCR12, BGBSVC, and others</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">These are misc components, and as such
typically serve non-central roles. BGBSCR12 was actually the original
form of this project, but the components have largely split off and
inflated greatly. BGBSVM was part of this original core, intended
mostly to be modified into an ECMAScript/JavaScript engine, BGBSVC
was the core GC and typesystem from BGBSCR12, but stripped down and
re-scoped, ...<br>
<br>
Some of this stuff is atrophied as well...</p>
