More thoughts for another codegen.

Goals:
Uses GC this time.
	Sufficiently "proven" with 3D engine.
Internally register-based.
Uses TVars.
Uses stack-based IL (again, based on BGBScriptVM IL).
Readily supports plug-in logic (new types, new operations).
Decent support for OO and variants.

Types:
Canonical Type Object
	Map 1:1 with signature-strings.

Stack:
Uses traditional stack-frames;
Ideally supports split stacks.

Registers:
Use TVar register caching.
TVars are the primary means of performing operations.
TVars will not be reused (but their underlying register and/or stack
location may be reused).
