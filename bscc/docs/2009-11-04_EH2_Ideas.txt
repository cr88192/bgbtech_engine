Idea:
more C-friendly exception handling mechanism, which "should" play nicer with other possibilities, and with possible implementations.

Consider allowing 'goto' here.

dyehBegin();
pfoo=dyehCatch("Foo");
if(pfoo)goto CatchFoo;
goto Try;
EndTry:
dyehEnd();
Try:
	...
	goto EndTry;
CatchFoo:
	...

it is not ideal, but should be workable in plain C.
