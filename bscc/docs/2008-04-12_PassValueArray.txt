Basic Idea:
Some types are represented as pass-by-value arrays.
This would be the case for matrices and similar.

Implementation-wise, pass-by-value arrays will be represented in much the same way as pass-by-reference arrays, namely, by passing a pointer to the first item.

Variable storage for the arrays will be implemented as for usual arrays.
When assigned, such an array will be copied to the new location.
