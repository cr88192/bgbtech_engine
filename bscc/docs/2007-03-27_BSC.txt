BSC

Will be a lang based around C99, but will offer a number of extensions intended for being used on the VM side to access both C and script functionality.

The goal will be that it is backwards compatible with C, for the most part at least. If avoidable existing code should not have to be modified.


BSC will define some additional types:
elem		Dynamically typed value;
object	Prototype object
list		List of cons cells
...

Conversions to/from these types will be handled automatically if possible.
