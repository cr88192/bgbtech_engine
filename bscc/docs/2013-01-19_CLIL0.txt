CLIL: C-Like Intermediate Language

Another codegen idea, but this time with the idea being that the IL is an unstructured vaguely C-like language.

Labels and goto are the primary control-flow mechanisms, with if-goto as the secondary control-flow mechanism.

Frames will exist and serve a similar role to functions, except that a frame is not necessarily the entry point of a function, nor is a return necessarily the exit point.

public labels will be identified as "frame.label".

Types:
s8, s16, s32, s64: signed integers
u8, u16, u32, u64: unsigned integers
int: integer, pointer-sized.


syntax:
label:
goto label;
goto label(args);
goto *var;
goto *var(args);

call label;
call label(args);
call *var;
call *var(args);


rettype name(args)
{
	decls...
	labels and statements...
}
