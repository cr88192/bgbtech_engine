Thought: DYC Auxilary Objects

Idea:
System by which non-DYC objects may be made usable via the DYC system, and may gain features typical of DYC objects (such as inheritence).

Limits:
Will limit to BGBDY objects, with some features limited to registered structural types.


Non-structural types will require using DYII.
Conceptually, "object" will map to dyt and DYII, rather than to dycObject.

Some means to associate a given type-name to a given class is needed.


Structural Objects will be handled by an "Auxilary Class", which will be similar to a normal class, except it will be handled differently.

An instance of an auxilary class will simply encode a reference to the auxilary object type (C struct with a dytname).

A subclass of an auxilary class will include the auxilary type as a field.

An auxilary class may not physically extend another class (it may only implement interfaces).
