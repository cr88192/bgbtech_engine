TVIR: TVar IR.

will be internal to the codegen;
likely SSA form;
likely to be handled as arrays of struct pointers.

General Form:
<opcode> <type> <dest> <src*>

Opcode is a magic opcode number;
Type is a type handle;
Dest is the target tvar (generally created via said operation);
Src is 0 or more source operands.


Traditional (named) variables will not be TVars, and unlike TVars, will remain mutable.
TVars will be identified via handles, which will generally be linearly increasing integers.

TVars will be merged via phi operators, which will directly follow labels.
