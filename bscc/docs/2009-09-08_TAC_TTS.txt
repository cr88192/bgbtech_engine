goal:
Standalone TAC/SSA, and Tagged Type System

TAC/SSA:

opcode:type dst, srca, srcb
call dst, func, args*
callz func, args*


TTS:
Will be a rework/adaptation of the RPNIL/SXIL internal type system, combined with generic precise-MM like facilities;
This system will primarily focus on facilities useful to implement a compiler, rather than those which would be useful in a dynamic VM, even as such, there may be some overlap.

TTS will use a unified handle system, which will be implemented as tagged values with the low 4 bits for the tag.

TTSVal
Value<28>:Tag<4>

Tags 12-15 will expand an additional 4 bits.

Value<24>:TagB<4>:TagA<4>

Allowing 64 types: Tag=((TagA-12)<<4)|TagB.
Tags 0-11 will be reserved.
