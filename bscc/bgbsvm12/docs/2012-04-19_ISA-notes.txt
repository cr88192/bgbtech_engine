Notes regarding the ISA:

Fixnum ops currently accept all small integer types (including int32, which does not necessarily fit into a fixnum).

Int and Fixnum have different ranges, however "fixnum" ops will assume the int32 range.

_FN: fixnum / integer (generic).
_FL: flonum.
_FV: value-variant.

_XI: int.
_XL: long.
_XF: float.
_XD: double.
