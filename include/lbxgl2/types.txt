//movetypes
move_none		//doesn't move
move_push		//straight line, pushes some things, ignores collisions and gravity
move_toss		//arc'ed path, stops when it lands
move_bounce		//bounce of objects until running out of speed (consider: move_elastic)
move_fly		//move in a straight line, blocked by collisions, ignores gravity
move_slide		//slide along on ground
move_slideresist	//slide along ground with friction
move_character	//hmm... I forget why I added this

//solidtypes
//"basic" solidtypes
solid_not		//non-solid
solid_trigger	//bbox, detects collisions but does not block
solid_bbox		//axis aligned bbox
solid_prim		//brushmodels and such
solid_bsp		//synonym for solid_prim

//"complex" solidtypes
solid_skel		//skeletal model, eventually may be a collection of obbs with ik and such
