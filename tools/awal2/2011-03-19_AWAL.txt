AWAL: Animated WAL

Goals:
Be a simplistic video format;
Serve a similar role to RoQ;
...

Probably AWL extension.


Details:

struct AWAL_Head_s {
char name[32];		//cannonical base name
int width;		//width (power of 2)
int height;		//height (power of 2)
int offset;		//compressed data offset
int size;		//compressed data size
int fcc;		//codec fourcc
int flags;		//flags
int contents;		//contents
int value;		//value
//reserved...
};


Codec:
'AWZ0'

Will, be a simplistic, PNG-like scheme.
Image data will be filtered and then deflated, and will consist of an array of individually encoded frames.

Playback will start with an image buffer initialized to all 0s, and each frame will be decoded and added on top of the prior frame (each frame is encoded with the prior frame subtracted out).

So, Encoding process:
	Prior image is subtracted out, creating a delta image;
	The image is color-converted and split into 4 planes (G, dR, dB, A);
	Paeth filtering is applied to each plane;
	The resultant planes are deflated.

Color Conversion:
G'=G
dR=R-G
dB=B-G
A'=A

The aim of this filter is to decorrelate colors without adding too much cost. This conversion is trivially and losslessly reversible.


struct AWZ0_FrameHead_s {
byte tag;	//0=EOF, 1=I-Frame, 2=P-Frame
byte resv[3];
int size;
