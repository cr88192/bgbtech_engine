Basically, a packaging format and ciphering scheme.
Deflate will first be used to compress the data, and then a cipher will be applied to the compressed data.

File
{
FOURCC magic;	//'BCE0'
u32 size;
byte data[size];
}

The 'data' field will contain the ciphered data.
This will contain a deflated data stream followed by a checksum.


Key State:
A 256-byte permutation will be maintained;
A 32-bit and 64-bit running hash will also be maintained.

32-bit hash update:
x'=x*65521+c

64-bit hash update:
