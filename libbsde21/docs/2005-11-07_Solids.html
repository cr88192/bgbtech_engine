Thoughts About the Implementation of Solids and Collision Response<br>
<br>
It is my experience that there has been a lack of sufficiently detailed info
on the web related to the implementation of geometric solids and calculation
of "adequate" contact forces.<br>
<br>
This will not attempt to go into much depth, but will aim to explain things
well enough to at least ease implementation.<br>
<br>
Seperating Axis Theory<br>
 For any 2 non-penetrating convex solids, there will exist an axis by which
the objects can be seperated.<br>
 If any axis is found where the objects' extents do not overlap, it can be
said that the objects do not interpenetrate.<br>
<br>
It is thus my opinion that the ability to project an object along an axis
should be a basic implementation factor.<br>
<br>
Boxes<br>
In my experience at the time of this writing, Bounding Boxes are one of the
main types of bounding volume. Arguably, it is most important that bounding
box behavior be good, even at the possible cost of other types. It is my
experience, however, that bounding boxes are fairly difficult to handle effectively.<br>
<br>
In a vaguely realistic mechanical simulation, many other types will have
behavior that is inappropriate for the object in question.<br>
If a brick falls from some height above the ground, it would be rather unrealistic
to have the brick roll around on the ground as if it were a can of spray
paint, or, worse, to behave like some kind of ball. A cube will adequately
model the desired mechanical behavior of many common objects.<br>
