Internally, the basic unit of length will be the meter, the basic unit of volume the cubic meter, and the basic unit of mass the megagram.

As such, the density of water will be calibrated at 1.

By default, the external interface will represent the unit of length as the meter, the unit of volume as the liter, and the unit of mass as the kilogram (again, 1).

Could stick to current definition:
meter, cubic meter, and megagram.
