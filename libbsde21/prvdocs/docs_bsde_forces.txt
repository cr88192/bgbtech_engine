PushVel
Object is pushed in a certain direction, and accelerated in that direction so long as the velocity in that direction is below the pushvel.

Intent is for use on things like characters or other objects that need to move at near a fixed speed regardless of forces like friction.

Side issues:
Forces perpendicular to this force (eg: gravity and horizontal forces).
These may be desirable in many cases (that of characters), less so for some other objects.
It may also make sense to weight this value, eg, since in some cases (eg: no contact with ground, being on ice, ...) would naturally effect movement of a character.

This would imply a different force than one applied directly to an object, eg, one that is computed using friction as a propelling force. This would also allow, eg, trying to walk forward to generate a backwards force on an object being walked on. Likewise the force would be clamped to the collision plane as is the case for friction.

Different forces may then be needed for in-air and on-contact variations, that or use of modifier flags.

It may make sense to have different forces, eg, so both gravity and walking forces could be done if needed.
Forces could also be used for conveyors on static objects...


PushAccel
A constant acceleration is provided in a particular direction.
