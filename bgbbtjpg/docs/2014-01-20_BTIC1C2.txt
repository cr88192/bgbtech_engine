AVI FOURCC: bt1c / c1tb (BTIC1C mode)

Update FOURCC: BTIC / bt1c


AVI FOURCC: rpza / azpr (RPZA emulation mode)


Description:

Basically RPZA, but with a few possible additions:
* Ability to encode references to runs of prior blocks;
* Formally defining alpha-support;
* Probably also putting it in a TLV packaging;
* ...

Other Extensions:
* Deflate Compression
* More features / modes for encoding blocks
* ...


=== Baseline ===

Baseline Mode:
* Only RPZA-like features and Deflate/'ZI' images are used.
* Alternate modes are not allowed for baseline videos nor required to be supported by a decoder.


== File Structure ==

File structure for images is:
* Top-Level File Header (Standalone Files Only)
* (Opt) Headers* (Invalid in RPZA Mode)
* Base Image
** (Opt) Alpha Extension
* Headers*
** Component Layers (for Base Image)
* Tag Layers
** Component Layers (for each tag layer).
*** Image Data (for each component layer)
*** (Opt) Alpha Extension

Currently, all layers will have the same resolution and format.


=== TLV ===

TLV Bytes:
* 0xE0: End-Of-Image Marker
* 0xE1: len=Word24, Image Data
* 0xE2: Reserved
* 0xE3: len=Word24, tag=TWOCC
* 0xE4: len=Word24, tag=FOURCC
* 0xE5: len=Byte, tag=TWOCC
* 0xE6: len=Word56, tag=FOURCC

Values will be encoded in big-endian ordering.

Each chunk header will be followed by the payload, and the length will include the size of the header.


=== Headers ===

BTIC1C Mode will have the header:
 TWOCC('HD')
   xsize:WORD
   ysize:WORD
   imgtype:BYTE
   clrmode:BYTE
   mipstart:BYTE
   mipend:BYTE
   flags:DWORD

ImgType:
* 0=RGBA
* 1=RGB
* 16=DXT1 (Opaque)
* 18=DXT5
* 21=BC6H_SF16 (1)
* 22=BC7 (1)
* 23=DXT1F (DXT1 Fast)
* 24=DXT5F (DXT5 Fast)
* 25=DXT1A (DXT1+Alpha)
* 26=DXT5-UVAY (U, V, A, Y)
* 27=BC7_SRGB (1)
* 28=BC6H_UF16 (1)

ClrMode:
* 0=RGB(A)
* 1=YCbCr
* 2=RCT
* 3=YCoCg

The image type and color mode will mostly indicate the intended target format for decoding the image.
This is more of a hint than an edict, and may provide a hint to the decoder/renderer which format it should use (if possible) for decoding.

They may also effect the interpretation of some members.


MipStart and MipEnd may indicate the presence of additional mip-levels. These will exist as a series recursively downsampled versions of the image. The number of encoded mip-levels will be ((MipEnd-MipStart)+1).

Mipmaps will be placed end-to-end in the image, with the first/largest mip-level being present first.
The size of the image will also be padded to a complete row of blocks.

This header may be placed after the image data for the base plane.


(1): These modes would effectively require higher bit-depths than BTIC1C can currently provide to be effective.
Would need to devise a "good" way to support the extended bit-depth.


=== Layers ===

* TWOCC('CL')
** Component Layer.
** Layer Name is given as an ASCIZ string.

* TWOCC('TL')
** Tag Layer.
** Layer Name is given as an ASCIZ string.

These will be positional markers and directly precede the data which they apply to.

Implicitly, each layer will end when a new layer begins. Component layers will end prior component layers, and tag layers will end both component and tag layers.

Zero or more strings may follow the initial layer name, which may give additional parameters in key/value form.


=== BTIC1C + Deflate ===

FOURCC: 'B1CZ'

Basically, the same format as above, but with the entire frame Deflate-compressed and put into a buffer.
The compressed data will include a Zlib header.


TWOCC: 'ZL'

Alternate form for a Deflated frame.


TWOCC: 'ZI'

Deflate-compressed image. This will only apply to a single image (and extension images), and will not include the headers or other layers (which will be stored separately).

Of these, only 'ZI' is currently used.


TWOCC: 'ZA'

Deflate + Arithmetic Mode.

Possible: [[BTLZA]]


=== Top Level File Header ===

This appears at the start of a standalone file, and serves mostly to identify the format.
This is not used with an AVI container.

 magic:BYTE[8]="BTIC1C\r\n";		//magic sequence
 size:DWORD						//file payload size
 check:DWORD;					//Adler32 checksum (optional)
 ... TLV Data ...


== General ==

Values will be encoded in big-endian order.
The image will be encoded in a raster order starting from the upper-left corner of the image.

Image structure will generally consist of an opcode byte followed by any data.


Opcode Byte:
* High 3 bits hold opcode;
* Low 5 bits hold run length, or data.

Lengths will be stored minus one, so an operation will apply to length+1 blocks.

For example, 0x80 will encode a skip of 1 block, and 0x9F will encode a skip of 32 blocks.


Opcode Byte Ranges:
* 0x00-0x7F:
**  Raw Block
* 0x80-0x9F:
**  Skip (Reuse from prior frame)
* 0xA0-0xBF:
**  Single Color Run
**  Color Bit 15=Alpha / Transparent
***    May indicate(2) alpha blended colors (RGBA3534).
***    Otherwise (3) uses RGB555 (with full transparency assumed).
***    Otherwise may indicate (if enabled) use of differential colors.
**  Else:
***    Opaque Color in RGB555.
* 0xC0-0xDF:
**  Pixel Blocks
**  ColorA Bit 15:
***    (Drop) Indicates(2) alpha blended colors (RGBA3534).
***    (New) Indicates Diff Color Mode
**  ColorB Bit 15:
***    Enables direct transparency (RGB555).
* 0xE0-0xFF:
**  Extended Ops, Low 5=Op Number
***    0xE0: End Of Image / Mode-Escape
****      Default Mode: End Of Image
****      Alternate Modes: Jump to Default Mode.
*****       Shorthand for F0,F0
***    0xE1: Image Data, Len=Word24
***    0xE2(1): TLV Chunk A, Tag=Byte, Len=Word
***    0xE3(1): TLV Chunk B, Len=Word24, Tag=TWOCC
***    0xE4(1): TLV Chunk C, Len=Word24, Tag=FOURCC
***    0xE5(1): TLV Chunk D, Len=Byte, Tag=TWOCC
****      Within image data, these will be used for optional features.
****      If the first character of the tag is upper-case, this is Must-Understand.
****      Otherwise, unrecognized markers are ignored.
***    0xE6: Drop / Reserved
***    0xE7: Drop / Reserved

***    0xEC(1): Run (Length=Byte, Dist=Byte)
***    0xED(1): Run (Length=Byte, Dist=Word)
***    0xEE(1): Skip / Translate
****      Next Byte Top 3 Bits:
*****       000: 13-bit Skip
*****       001: Len(5b), Y-Offs(4b), X-Offs(4b)
*****       010: Len(13b), Y-Offs(8b), X-Offs(8b)
*****       011: Reserved
****      Encodes a longer skip and/or a Skip+Translate
****      A Skip+Translate will copy a run of blocks from the prior frame relative to the current position.
****      Each offset will use bias values (8 and 128), and will always use the full-length scanline for Y.
***    0xEF(1): Set Controller
****      Next Byte, High 3: Mode
*****       000: Enable Feature (5-bit ID)
*****       001: Disable Feature (5-bit ID)

***    0xF0-0xF7(1): Mode Prefix (Modes 0-7)
***    0xF8-0xFB(1): Multi-Byte Commands (Global)
***    0xFC-0xFF(1): Multi-Byte Commands (Mode Specific)
****      F8/F9, FC/FD: Two Byte Commands
*****       Another byte follows, giving the second byte of the command.
****      FA/FE: Three Byte Commands
*****       Two bytes follow giving the command.
*****       0x2020-0x7F7F represents a TWOCC space.
****      FB/FF: Five Byte Commands
*****       Four bytes follow giving the command.
*****       0x20202020-0x7F7F7F7F represents a FOURCC space.


(1): Invalid in RPZA mode.

Note that run lengths and offsets will be stored minus one, so the maximum length is 256 and the maximum distance for a word is 65536.

The distance may be less than the length, which may be used to encode repeating patterns of blocks.

(2): N/A in RPZA and DXT1 modes or with an Alpha-Extension chunk, where only RGB555 may be used.
In RPZA mode, this may give a "generic" transparent color.
Effectively deprecated/dropped.

(3): N/A with AX chunk.


* 0xFC, 0x80-0x9F (4)
** Run of flat colors (1-32).
** Followed by N colors, with a single color for each block.

(4): Invalid in BTIC1C Baseline


=== Alternate Modes ===

Alternate modes may provide alternative ways to encode blocks more compactly.

This system is modal and thus depends on an explicit "state", as well as several tables:
* A 256-color palette with RGB555 colors (or higher)
* A 16-color palette with RGB555 colors (or higher)
* A 256-entry table of block patterns (32-bits each).

These tables will be preserved between frames, however the image will reset to Default-Mode (RGB555 colors and 32-bit pixel blocks) at the start of each image frame.

Mode Prefix bytes will allow indicating a command which will be interpreted as-if the block were encoded in this mode.

A Default-Mode prefix followed by another mode prefix byte will be interpreted as a Mode-Set command.


Mode Prefix Bytes:
*    0xF0: Default-Mode Prefix, Mode Set
*    0xF1: SLQA (8-bit index color mode, 16-bit PixelBlock16)
*    0xF2: SLQB (4-bit index color mode, 8-bit PixelIndex8)
*    0xF3: SLQC (8-bit index color mode, 8-bit PixelIndex8)
*    0xF4: SLQD (normal/diff color mode, 16-bit PixelBlock16)
*    0xF5: SLQE (normal/diff color mode, 8-bit PixelBlock8)

Mode Commands (N/A in Default Mode):
*      0xE0: Return to Default-Mode
*      0xF8, 0x81: Reset Tables
**        Palettes and tables should be reset to default values.
*      0xF8, 0x82: Update 256 Color Palette (RGB555)
**        Start:Byte, End:Byte, Colors:RGB555[(End-Start)+1]
**        Update Palette using RGB555 colors.
*      0xF8, 0x83: Update 16-color Palette (8-bit indices)
**        StartEnd:Byte, Colors:Byte[(End-Start)+1]
**        Colors will index into the 256-color palette.
*      0xF8, 0x84: Update 16-color Palette (RGB555)
**        StartEnd:Byte, Colors:RGB555[(End-Start)+1]

*      0xF8, 0x85: Update Block Patterns (for PixelIndex)
**        Start:Byte, End:Byte, Pattern:PixelBlock32[(End-Start)+1]

** Default 256-color palette will be:
*** 0-15: Basic 16 colors.
*** 16-31: 16 shades of gray.
*** 32-255: 224 colors (7x8x4).
** The default 16-color palette will have the usual basic 16 colors (HiRGB).


Controller 0: Block Mode (Allows modes beyond mode 7).


Possible: Change way modes are handled, make features individually selectable with the mode basically as a way of choosing a combination of features (Color Type, Block Type, ...).

Mode 0 would remain as a fixed default mode though, so only 1-7 could be made customizable.

Also possible: Modes 1-7 are basically presets from a potentially larger mode table, with modes being assignable from a larger table of available modes.

* 0: RGB555 / Diff7, PixelBlock32
* 1: Index8, PixelBlock16
* 2: Index4, PixelIndex8
* 3: Index8, PixelIndex8
* 4: RGB555 / Diff7, PixelBlock16

* 7: RGB31FS / Diff15, PixelBlock32
* 8: RGB31FU / Diff15, PixelBlock32
* 9: RGBA31 / Diff15, PixelBlock32


Note:
* Full precision may not be preserved if more than that supported by the output, the encoder should not produce output which solely depends on a particular color depth.


=== Colors ===

Stored in big-endian order.

RGB555 = x.RRRRR.GGGGG.BBBBB

RGBA3534 = x.AAAA.RRR.GGGGG.BBB (Dropped)


Alpha-blended colors will have both colors in the block use the RGBA3534 format.

Alpha blended modes will not be supported for decoding to DXT1, which will instead interpret alpha color-blocks as fully transparent, and pixel-blocks as opaque. Likewise, alpha-blended colors are invalid in RPZA mode.

In both DXT1 and RPZA mode, the color will be interpreted as being RGB555.
This will also be the behavior in DXT5 mode if an Alpha Extension chunk is present.

If RGB555 colors are converted to 24-bit or 32-bit RGB(A), then the high order bits will be copied to the low bits.

For example, 5 bits are mapped to 8 bits as:
* 76543 -> 76543765


==== Extended Colors ====

RGB23 = x.P.RRRRRRR.GGGGGGGG.BBBBBBB

RGBA31 = x.P.RRRRRRR.GGGGGGGG.BBBBBBB.AAAAAAAA

RGB31FU = x.P.RRRRRRRRRR.GGGGGGGGGG.BBBBBBBBBB

RGB31FS = x.P.RRRRRRRRRR.GGGGGGGGGG.BBBBBBBBBB

The x bit is unused in the color value.

The P bit is basically a shared low order bit.
For RGB23 and RGBA31, it will encode the low order bit for B and R.
For RGB31F it will apply to all 3 colors.

For the 31F variants, the color will represent the high order bits of a half-float:
* 31U = EEEEE.FFFFF
* 31S = S.EEEEE.FFFF
** 31S encodes a sign at the cost of one mantissa bit.

For expanding out the values, the rules will be as such:
* The color bits are copied to their place in the output value;
* If applicable, the P bit is copied below these bits.
* Any remaining bits are filled in by copying the high-order bits.

For example, a 31U value abcdefghij would be expaneded to a 16-bit half-float as:
* 0abcdefghijPabcd


=== Differential Colors ===

x.ddddddd

With a differential color block, the color will be predicted from adjacent blocks:
* C B
* A x

This will be handled by running a Paeth predictor on the RGB555 pixel-blocks.

* ddddddd: 5x5x5 cube, -2..2
** (dR*5+dG)*5+dB

A scale factor will indicate the magnitude of the delta:
* 0: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
* 1: -4, -1, 0, 1, 4
* 2: -6, -2, 0, 2, 6
* 3: -8, -2, 0, 2, 8
* 4: -13, -3, 0, 3, 13
* 5: -17, -5, 0, 5, 17
* 6: -23, -7, 0, 7, 23
* 7: -29, -9, 0, 9, 29

0..124: Deltas.

* F8 8F xx: Set Diff Color Mode
** 00: Disable
** 01: Last Block
** 02: Paeth (Per RGB Block)
** 03: Paeth2 (Per Component)
* F8 90: Set Scale=0
* F8 91: Set Scale=1
* ...
* F8 96: Set Scale=6
* F8 97: Set Scale=7
* Special Scales
** F8 98: Set Scale=8
** ...
** F8 9F: Set Scale=15


Simple Color Deblocking:
* F8 A0: Deblock Mode: None
* F8 A1: Deblock Mode: Left (Interpolate)
* F8 A2: Deblock Mode: Up (Interpolate)
* F8 A3: Deblock Mode: Up/Left (Interpolate)
* F8 A4: Deblock Mode: Full (Interpolate)
* F8 A5: Deblock Mode: Left (Extrapolate)
* F8 A6: Deblock Mode: Up (Extrapolate)
* F8 A7: Deblock Mode: Up/Left (Extrapolate)

These indicate that flat color blocks will instead give a gradient.
With interpolate, the color will give the value for the lower/right corner, and the other color will be given by the upper/left block (or an average of the up and left blocks).

With extrapolate, it will be similar, except that the color will give the center value (and the lower/right value will be extrapolated, 2C-P).

Note: Left and Up/Left will only apply to the first block in a color-span, after which point it will behave as None or Up. Up/Left extrapolate with multi-block runs will only extrapolate Up, but will interpolate Left.


==== Diff15 (Possible) ====

xrrrrrgg gggbbbbb

Differences will be similar to the 8-bit case, but will differ mostly in the range of the difference values.

Scale will apply similarly as well, with 0 mapping directly from -16..15.

Scales 1-7 will approximately follow a log scale (RGB24 / RGBA31):
* 1: -32..32
* 2: -48..48
* 3: -64..64
* 4: -96..96
* 5: -128..128
* 6: -192..192
* 7: -256..256

Scales RGB31F (Expanded to 16):
* 0: -16..15
* 1: -32..32
* 2: -48..48
* 3: -64..64
* 4: -96..96
* 5: -128..128
* 6: -192..192
* 7: -256..256
* 8: -512..512
* 9: -1024..1024
* 10: -2048..2048
* 11: -4096..4096
* 12: -8192..8192
* 13: -16384..16384
* 14: -32768..32768
* 15: -65536..65536


=== Pixel Blocks (Default 32-bit) ===

After ColorA and ColorB, there will be pixel bits for one or more blocks.

Each block will be 4x4 pixels, with 2 bits per pixel.

These pixel blocks will be encoded with the left pixel in the high 2 bits.


If using direct (non-interpolated) transparency:
*	0=ColorB
*	1=Average (1/2 ColorB + 1/2 ColorA)
*	2=Transparent
*	3=ColorA

Otherwise (Opaque and Alpha-Blend modes):
*	0=ColorB
*	1=2/3 ColorB + 1/3 ColorA
*	2=1/3 ColorB + 2/3 ColorA
*	3=ColorA


==== 16-bit pixel blocks (PixelBlock16) ====

Each block will be 4x4 pixels, with 1 bit per pixel:
*	0=ColorB
*	1=ColorA


==== 8-bit pixel 2x2 blocks (PixelBlock8) ====

Each block will be 2x2 pixels, with 2 bits per pixel:
*	0=ColorB
*	1=2/3 ColorB + 1/3 ColorA
*	2=1/3 ColorB + 2/3 ColorA
*	3=ColorA


==== 8-bit pixel blocks (PixelIndex8) ====

Will be an approximate pixel block, with the following bit definitions:
* ABCDHVSS
* ABCD
** Will refer to the 4 corners of the block
** Will indicate whether the 2x2 pixel block is initially set or clear.
* H: Horizontal Bar (Middle 2 pixels, across block)
* V: Vertical Bar (Middle 2 pixels, across block)
* SS: Softness
** 0=Hard, No softening
** 1=SoftenAvg, Blur + Round Nearest
** 2=SoftenDn, Blur + Round Down
** 3=SoftenUp, Blur + Round Up

Cases where ABCD=15 will be special dither patterns:
* H: Half Horizontal
* V: Half Vertical
* SS:
** 0=Full Range
** 1=Middle Range
** 2=1/3 Range
** 3=2/3 Range


=== Raw Block ===

Represents a raw opaque block.

ColorA will use the opcode as the MSB.

ColorB will be RGB555.

If bit 15 is set, then ColorB will be followed by 4 bytes encoding the interpolated pixels.

Otherwise, ColorB will be followed by 14 more colors encoding raw color values (A block will be given as an array of 16 pixel colors).


=== Alpha Extension ===

In alpha extension mode, the image will be encoded as a pair.

The first image will be encoded the same as a raw RGB image in BTIC1C-DXT1 or PPZA mode. Bitwise alpha may be used (albeit ignored). Blended and Split Alpha are invalid in this mode.

A secondary image will be encoded inside a TWOCC('AX') chunk directly following the image chunk, which will use a similar opcode format to the main image and encode the alpha component.

* 0x00-0x7F
** AlphaAB, PixelBlock
* 0x80-0x9F
** Same, Encodes a skip in the Alpha plane.
* 0xA0-0xBF
** Flat alpha blocks.
** Alpha, will encode the alpha value in the low 7 bits.
** Bit 7 is reserved.
* 0xC0-0xDF
** AlphaAB, PixelBlock+
* 0xE0-0xFF
** Same


Alpha value will be a byte with the alpha in the low 7 bits, if bit 7 is clear.

If bit 7 is set, it will be 16 bits with alpha in the low 8, and 3 refine bits (bits 8-10).


AlphaAB will encode AlphaA and AlphaB into a 16 or 32-bit quantity.
* Bit 7 of first byte is 0
** 16 bits are used.
** First byte has AlphaA in the low 7 bits.
** Second byte has AlphaB in the low 7 bits.
* Bit 7 of first byte is 1
** 32 bits are used.
** First 16 bit quantity has AlphaA in the low 8 bits, and 3 RefineA bits (bits 8-10).
** Second 16 bit quantity has AlphaB in the low 8 bits and 3 RefineB bits.


RefineA/B are bits which may be used to refine the color of the main pixel block.

In the DXT5 case, bit 2 of each will encode the low bit of the green component.
For RGBA decoding, they will be used to refine the gamma of the RGB triple.

Unused bits are to be set to 0.


PixelBlocks will remain 32-bits, using the same format as for color pixel blocks.
