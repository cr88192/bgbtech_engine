Possible: 1 Bit Image.

Purpose:

Image Data is stored at 1 bit per pixel, and may be quickly decoded.
This could be a cheaper option (than JPEG images) for storing Alpha data for images where pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque.

Sub-Goal: Should try to avoid generating 0xFF bytes.


Format:

Split image into 8x8 pixel blocks (64 bits).

Use Block-Pack from BTIC.

Special Commands:
254, 0: Block, All Bits 0
254, 1: Block, All Bits 1
254, 2: Image XSize, YSize

FMT12/APP12, "BP1B"


Alternative:
8x8 pixel blocks are represented raw and then deflated.
Pixel bits are packed into each byte starting with the MSB.

Needs to be stored between the SOF0 and SOS markers.

FMT12/APP12, "BA1Z"


Also Possible:
Do like the above, but use Grey Coding and RLE.

"BA1R"


Possible: "BA8Z"
Possible, 8-Bit Alpha.

Stored basically similarly to BA1Z, except using 8bits/pixel, and Paeth filtered.
