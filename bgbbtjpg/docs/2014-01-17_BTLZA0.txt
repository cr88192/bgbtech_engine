BTLZA: BGBTech LZ77 + Arithmetic

Goals:
* Deflate-like encoder but with Arithmetic Coding;
* Ideally, sort of like LZMA but cheaper/faster;
* Should ideally compress better than Deflate or Deflate + Arithmetic;
* Should be mostly drop-in-compatible.

In cases where a Zlib header is expected by the format, a Faux Zlib Header will be used.

== Coded Stream ==

=== Coded Blocks ===

Blocks will be tagged using a 1-bit final-block indicator followed by a 2 bit block-type ID.
Bits will be read from bytes starting from the LSB.

Block Types will use a 2-bit ID:
* 0: Stored Data
* 1: Fixed Table
* 2: Dynamic Table
* 3: Escape Case
** 3-bit secondary type follows.
** 0=Reserved
** 1=Arithmetic Mode Header
** 2=Dynamic Table 2
** 3=Fixed Table 2
** 4=Direct AC Block

Block types 0, 1, and 2 will be the same as normal Deflate (as defined in RFC1951).

If in Deflate64 Mode, the blocks will be nearly identical, but with a few slight differences:
* The dictionary will be extended to 64kB.
** The last 2 entries in the distance table will be used for these lengths.
* Symbol 285 will have 16 extra bits.
** It will encode a value from 3 to 65538.


==== Stored Data ====

Stored data is stored in an uncompressed form.

* len:WORD, nLen:WORD, data:byte[len]
** len: Length of stored data
** nLen: ~len
** data: raw byte data.


==== Fixed Huffman Table ====

In this mode, the Huffman table will used fixed code-lengths.
* 0-143: 8 bits
* 144-255: 9 bits
* 256-279: 7 bits
* 280-287: 8 bits

==== Fixed Huffman Table 2 ====

Similar to the normal Fixed Huffman Table, except that a table-ID is given:
* Hl(3): TableID, Literal
* Hd(2): TableID, Distance

TableID, Literal:
* 0, Same literal table as before, expanded distance table
** 0-143: 8 bits
** 144-255: 9 bits
** 256-279: 7 bits
** 280-287: 8 bits
*** Match lengths are limited to 1kB
* 1, Expanded A.
** 0-127: 8 bits
** 128-383: 9 bits
*** 0xxxxxx: 0-127 8 bit
*** 1xxxxxxx: 128-383
* 2, Expanded B.
** 0-255: 9 bits
** 256-383: 8 bits
*** 0xxxxxx: 256-383 8 bit
*** 1xxxxxxx: 0-255

TableID, Distance:
* 0:
** 0-63: 6 bits (Window: Full Range)
* 1:
** 0-31: 5 bits (Window: 64kB)
* 2:
** 0-15: 4 bits (Window: 256 bytes)
* 3:
** 0-7: 3 bits (Window: 16 bytes)

==== Dynamic Huffman Table ====

* Hl(5) bits: Number of coded literal symbols (minus 257, 257-288).
* Hd(5) bits: Number coded distance symbols (minus 1, 1-32).
* Hc(4) bits: Number of header symbols (minus 4, 4-19).
** Hcl(Hc*3): Header symbol code lengths
*** Encoded in the following order:
**** 16, 17, 18, 0, 8,7, 9,6, 10,5, 11,4, 12,3, 13,2, 14,1, 15

This is followed by the literal and distance tables, which are encoded as such:
* 0-15: Code Length
* 16: Rc(2), Repeat prior code length 3-7 times.
* 17: Zc(3), Code length of 0 for 3 to 10 times.
* 18: Zc(7), Code length of 0 for 11 to 138 times.


==== Dynamic Huffman Table 2 ====

Similar to the normal Dynamic Huffman Table, except for a few sizes and similar:
* Hr(3): Reserved, must be 0
* Hl(7): Number of coded literal symbols (minus 257, 257-384).
* Hd(6): Number coded distance symbols (minus 1, 1-64).
* Hc(5): Number of header symbols (minus 4, 4-35).
** Hcl(Hc*3): Header symbol code lengths


==== Arithmetic Mode Header ====

Hr(3): Header Mode

* 0: Disable Arithmetic Coding
** Cancels out of arithmetic coding, returns to using raw bits.

* 1: Enable Arithmetic Coding (Mode A)
** Hl(4)+12: Size of Context
** Hw(5): Dictionary Window Size
*** Enables the use of a arithmetic-coding mode.
*** In this mode, Huffman coded symbols and extra bits are secondarily fed through a bitwise arithmetic coder.
*** No distinction is made between the types of bits (All bits will use a single shared context model).
*** Logically, bits are read/written in LSB-first ordering.

* 2: Enable Arithmetic Coding (Mode B)
** Hl(5): Size of Literal Symbol Context
** Hd(5): Size of Distance Symbol Context
** Hx(5): Size of Extra-Bits Value Context
** HCx(5): Number of context-encoded Extra-Bits
*** After this count, fixed-probability bits will be used instead.
** Hy(5): Size of Raw-Bits Value Context
** Hw(5): Dictionary Window Size
*** Enables the use of a arithmetic-coding mode.
*** In this mode, Huffman coded symbols and extra bits are secondarily fed through a bitwise arithmetic coder.
*** Different types of bits will use different contexts.
*** Logically, bits are read/written in LSB-first ordering.


== Arithmetic Coder ==

To be filled in more once it stabilizes.

Basically, it uses a bit-at-a-time encoder, with a variable context size.

The context basically consists of the last N preceding bits, which is used as an index into a probabilities table. After encoding each bit, the context is shifted 1 bit and the encoded bit is added to the LSB (or MSB). 

This context is masked by the context-size, namely ((1<<n)-1), when accessing the model weights.

Encoded data bits may be written in LSB-first or MSB-first ordering.

There may be multiple models in use for different types of bits:
* L, Literal Symbol Bits
** Used for Literal Huffman Symbols
* D, Distance Symbol Bits
** Used for Distance Huffman Symbols
* X, Extra Bits
** Used for context-modeled extra-bits.
* R, Raw Bits
** Used for any non-categorized bits.
** This is the sole context for Arithmetic Mode A.
* F, Fixed
** Bits are always encoded with an equal probability.
** Note, will only eat 1 bit from the range.


=== Range and Weights ===

Logically, there will be several values in use:
* min: Lower bound of the coder range
* max: Upper bound of the coder range
* range=max-min: Difference between the lower and upper bounds
* val: Encoded value stream

A 10-bit weight value will be used.

A division bound will be calculated from the weight as:
* bound=(range>>10)*weight.
* Values above this point (rval>dval) will correspond to a logical 1 bit
** min=bound+1;
** weight=weight-(w>>5);
* Values less than or equal to this value will be interpreted as 0
** max=bound;
** weight=weight+((1024-w)>>5);


Normalization happens when the high 8 bits of min and max become equal.

For encoding:
* Write the high 8 bits to the output;
* min=(min<<8); max=(max<<8)|255;

For decoding:
* min=(min<<8); max=(max<<8)|255;
* val=(val<<8)|ReadByte();


== Faux Zlib Header ==

* 0xWMFF
** W=Log2 Window Size minus 8
** M=Method
*** 8=Deflate
*** 9=Deflate64
*** A=BTLZA
* FF=Flags and Check
** 0bLLDCCCCC
*** LL=Level, 0=Fastest, 3=Best Compression
*** D=Preset Dictionary
*** CC=Check Value

The check value is a special value which is set such that the header (seen as a 16-bit big-endian value) is a multiple of 31.

For methods 8 and 9, the compressed data is solely in Deflate or Deflate64 mode.
For method A, the data is in BTLZA Mode.

In these modes, the compressed data is to be followed by an Adler32 checksum of the expected output.

If the preset dictionary flag is set, the header is followed by an Adler32 checksum which may be used to identify the dictionary.



= Prior (Pre Redesign) =

== Faux Zlib Header ==

* 0xWMFF
** W=Log2 Window Size minus 8
** M=Method
*** 8=Deflate
*** 9=Deflate64
*** A=Deflate + Arithmetic
*** B=BTLZA
* FF=Flags and Check
** 0bLLDCCCCC
*** LL=Level, 0=Fastest, 3=Best Compression
*** D=Preset Dictionary
*** CC=Check Value

The check value is a special value which is set such that the header (seen as a 16-bit big-endian value) is a multiple of 31.

For methods 8 and 9, the compressed data is solely in Deflate or Deflate64 mode.
For method A, the data contains data Deflate+Arithmetic mode.
For method B, the data is in BTLZA Mode.

In these modes, the compressed data is to be followed by an Adler32 checksum of the expected output.


== Coded Stream ==

The first byte of the stream will be interpreted as such:
* If ((byte&0x06)==0x06):
** Start in BTLZA Mode
* Else:
** Start in Deflate Mode.
** Unless there is reason to assume otherwise, normal Deflate will be assumed.


=== BTLZA Mode Blocks ===

The compressed data will be stored as a sequence of "blocks". Blocks may be variable sized.

BTLZA-Mode headers will always be byte-aligned.

Block types are given by magic bytes.

6, 7, E, F

* 0xA0, size:VLI, data:byte[size]
** Stored Data Block
* 0xA6, mode:VLI, data:byte[]
** LZ+A Mode Block
** mode=Encoding Mode
*** Bits 0-3: Primary Context Size (12-27 bits)
*** Bit 4: Bit Endianess:
**** 0=MSB first
**** 1=LSB first
*** Bits 5-8: Window Size, 12-32 bits (64kB to 4GB)
* 0xA7, ...
** (Possible) BTLZH Mode
* 0xA8, ...
* 0xA9, ...
** Deflate or Deflate64 Mode
** This switches the stream into Deflate Mode.
* 0xAA / 0xAB, mode:VLI, data:byte[]
** Arithmetic coded Deflate or Deflate64 Block.
** mode=Encoding Mode
*** Bits 0-3: Primary Context Size (12-27 bits)
*** Bit 4: Bit Endianess:
**** 0=MSB first
**** 1=LSB first (Default)
* 0xAE, ...
** (Possible) BTLZHA Mode Block
*** BTLZH + Arithmetic
* ...
* 0x00
** End Of Data


=== Deflate Mode Blocks ===

In Deflate Mode, blocks will be tagged using a 1-bit final-block indicator followed by a 2 bit block-type ID.
Bits will be read from bytes starting from the LSB.

Block Types will use a 2-bit ID:
* 0: Stored Data
* 1: Fixed Table
* 2: Dynamic Table
* 3: Escape into BTLZA mode.
** This escape has slightly different behavior depending on its bit position:
*** Bit 1, The current byte is the BTLZA Marker.
*** Else, the marker will be found in the following byte.

Deflate Mode blocks will be the same as normal Deflate (as defined in RFC1951).

If in Deflate64 Mode, the blocks will be nearly identical, but with a few slight differences:
* The dictionary will be extended to 64kB.
** The last 2 entries in the distance table will be used for these lengths.
* Symbol 285 will have 16 extra bits.
** It will encode a value from 3 to 65538.


==== Deflate Stored Data ====

Stored data is stored in an uncompressed form.

* len:WORD, nLen:WORD, data:byte[len]
** len: Length of stored data
** nLen: ~len


==== Deflate Fixed Huffman Table ====

In this mode, the Huffman table will used fixed code-lengths.
* 0-143: 8 bits
* 144-255: 9 bits
* 256-279: 7 bits
* 280-287: 8 bits


==== Deflate Dynamic Huffman Table ====

* Hl(5) bits: Number of coded literal symbols (minus 257, 257-288).
* Hd(5) bits: Number coded distance symbols (minus 1, 1-32).
* Hc(4) bits: Number of header symbols (minus 4, 4-19).
** Hcl(Hc*3): Header symbol code lengths
*** Encoded in the following order:
**** 16, 17, 18, 0, 8,7, 9,6, 10,5, 11,4, 12,3, 13,2, 14,1, 15

This is followed by the literal and distance tables, which are encoded as such:
* 0-15: Code Length
* 16: Rc(2), Repeat prior code length 3-7 times.
* 17: Zc(3), Code length of 0 for 3 to 10 times.
* 18: Zc(7), Code length of 0 for 11 to 138 times.


=== BTLZH Mode (Possible) ===

Uses 3 Bit Type field:
* 0=Store
* 1=Reserved
* 2=Dynamic Huffman Table
* 3-5=Reserved
* 6/7=Escape


==== Huffman Table (BTLZH Mode) ====

Nearly identical to the above, except for a few sizes:
* Hr(3): Reserved, must be 0
* Hl(7): Number of coded literal symbols (minus 257, 257-384).
* Hd(6): Number coded distance symbols (minus 1, 1-64).
* Hc(5): Number of header symbols (minus 4, 4-35).
** Hcl(Hc*3): Header symbol code lengths


== Arithmetic Coder ==

To be filled in once it stabilizes.

Basically, it uses a bit-at-a-time encoder, with a variable context size.

The context basically consists of the last N preceding bits, which is used as an index into a probabilities table. After encoding each bit, the context is shifted left by 1 bit and the encoded bit is added to the LSB.


=== Deflate+Arithmetic Mode ===

The Deflate block will be arithmetic coded and stored in place.

Note that in this mode, multiple blocks may be encoded, and the final-block marker indicates an end to the arithmetic-coded block sequence (rather than the end of the BTLZA stream).

==== BTLZHA Mode ====

Nearly identical to Deflate + Arithmetic Mode.


== Symbols ==


=== Symbols (BTLZA / BTLZH) ===


Uses a 9-bit symbol coding for literal bytes and run-lengths.
* 0-255: Literal Byte
* 256: End Of Data
* 257-319: LZ77 Run
** Symbol encodes a prefix followed by 0 or more extra-bits (VLCB)
** The first 4 extra-bits will be context-coded, with any remaining extra-bits being fixed-probability.
** Will use the same basic stepping pattern as Deflate.
*** Effective match length will be 3 to 65538 characters.
*** Effectively, it is a VLCB value starting at 257 with 3 added to the value.
** Distances will also be encoded similarly:
*** 6-bit prefix (VLCA)
*** Followed by any extra-bits, with the first 4 bits context-encoded.
*** The shortest distance will be 0, this case will be special.
** After a run has been encoded, the final 24 bits of the run will be used to calculate the context.


=== Symbols (Deflate Mode) ===

* 0-255: Literal Byte
* 256: End Of Data
* 257-385: LZ77 Run
** Length is encoded as a VLCB value from 3-258.
** In Deflate Mode
*** Symbol 285 will represent 258 directly (No extra bits)
** In Deflate64 Mode
*** Symbol 285 will represent values in the range of 3-65538 (16 extra bits)

These cases will be called SVLCA and SVLCB.
